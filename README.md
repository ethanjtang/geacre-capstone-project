This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Any images or icons to be used put in the public folder and then refer to with /icon_name.filetype
for grabbing icons for the main Font Awesome is used and works well within the client-side pages follow

the use effect hook in the Chatbot layout.tsx and also go to Fontawesome.com to find icons and call them

using i tags within the code the necessary i tag should be given through Font awesome to copy

for Server-side icons copy icon i tag from FontAwesome but change 'class' to 'classname' 




## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
